      <description>Introduction The storage and preservation of digital data have become critical concerns in an age where information is increasingly digitized. A Tedium article on disc rot prompted a reflection on two personal experiences related to data loss and long-term storage, leading to profound questions about the feasibility and necessity of preserving digital data indefinitely. This post explores the complexities of long-term data storage, considers the implications of evolving file types, and delves into the philosophical question of whether all data should be preserved.</description>

      <description>Introduction Back in 2003, during my teenage years, I found myself rebelling against the idea of owning a mobile phone. Something about it just didn’t sit right with me. Perhaps, even at that young age, I sensed a future where increased social connections would lead to each one feeling less meaningful. Or maybe it was simply the reluctance to be available 24/7. I cherished the ritual of asking my parents to use the house phone, ensuring no one was online, and then calling a friend’s landline.</description>

      <title>Code, Data And Understanding Each Other In A Digital World</title>
      <link>https://strangelabs.io/blog/code-data-and-understanding-each-other/</link>

      <description>Introduction Our understanding of one another can only ever approximate true comprehension. We cannot inhabit each other&amp;rsquo;s consciousness to experience the world as the other does. Knowing that no one will ever truly understand you, how does that influence your experiences? We must dedicate time to learning each other&amp;rsquo;s stories and remain open-minded to align our understanding as closely as possible. This is already a challenge in our physical lives, but what happens in the digital realm?</description>

      <description>Why Should We Trust What People Hide from Us? Open source technology holds the potential to build greater trust among people. By extending the principles of open source from computer science to other areas of society and culture, we might unlock significant benefits.&#xA;What is open source?

      <description>Designing Buildings in the Future The future of architecture is evolving, giving rise to a new breed of architects with broader vision, deeper influence, and a more comprehensive understanding of their craft. These future architects won’t just design buildings in the traditional sense, from material selection to philosophical considerations, but will also grasp the intricacies of modern technology. They will understand everything from the flow of electrons in wiring to the connectivity of the internet, and how these elements interact with the building&amp;rsquo;s users in an increasingly digital world.</description>
