    <h2 id="what-happened-to-the-shop">What happened to the shop?!</h2>
<p>Way back in December 2019, which now seems like an age ago, I had made a decision to change the direction of Strange Labs from general PC repairs and upgrades to focus on building high end custom desktop PCs and web development work.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this?</strong></p>
<p>Well although Strange Labs was doing brilliantly at repairs and upgrades, my plan the whole time since I started in 2017 was to make a new type of technology shop - one which brought technology enthusiasts together to work on technology projects and investigate all sorts of emerging technologies on the way. Our Meetups were achieving this, but all my time was spent doing repairs and so without breaking off from that aspect of the business, I just couldn&rsquo;t put the time in to build the business I wanted.</p>
<p>So, at the end of 2019 I took some work from an international software development company and decided to downsize to a much smaller workshop with no retail space. I let my landlord know and gave him 3 months notice to end the lease. In those three months my landlord had found a new tenant, and then the world changed as we knew it.</p>
<h2 id="lockdown">Lockdown</h2>
<p>I could not turn back, having signed my way our of the shop and a new business signed their way in. So I had to leave the premises by April 1st. However, the smaller workshops I was planning to look at had all paused lettings and gone into lockdown like the rest of the world. Strange Labs had packed up and had no option but to put everything into storage and try to figure out the next steps. Alongside this the web development job was promptly cancelled with such uncertainty on funding in the near future. Strange Labs was left with no work and no shop and everything stuck in storage. And this is mostly how its been for the last 6 months!</p>
<h2 id="we-now-only-build-custom-pcs">We now only build custom PCs</h2>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t sit and twiddle my thumbs though, and so I relaunched the new website, and part of our new offerings: Custom PCs configured and built exactly for purpose unique to each customer. We were busy and completed a good number of PCs for clients across the UK. To start the process, you simply <a href="#contact">fill out our online form</a>: this sets out the initial requirements for your new computer. Strange Labs uses expert knowledge and experience of the industry to configure a perfectly fitting PC for your budget and delivers it to your door!</p>
<h2 id="double-disaster">Double disaster</h2>
<p>That would have been the end of the tale, Strange Labs sticking to online sales only, and wondering where to go next, but then I had another problem happen. Rather pathetically, I tripped and fell backwards, put my arms out to save my fall and broke them both. So since September I have had both my arms in recovery, unable to do anything with them! Thankfully by the time I am writing this post, my right arm is significantly better. My left arm shattered so will take a little while longer&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-future-plans">What are the future plans?</h2>
<p>Strange Labs is still almost entirely in storage, and I am unable to do any work with my arms. We have permanemtly closed the shop down on Gloucester Road and won&rsquo;t be reopening there. Currently, I am looking for a location for a new workshop somewhere near Bristol and the plan is to reopen in early 2021! I want to thank all our customers for their kind reviews and custom from our time on Gloucester Road and assure those who have enquired about PC builds through the website that we will be able to accomodate them early next year!</p>
