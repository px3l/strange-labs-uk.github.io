      <description>Introduction When setting up a fresh install of Windows 11, you&amp;rsquo;re prompted to log in with a Microsoft account by default. While this integration offers various benefits, such as seamless access to OneDrive and syncing settings across devices, many users prefer the privacy and control of a local account. However, Microsoft strongly encourages, to the point of forcing, the use of an online account during setup. In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the methods to bypass these attempts and successfully set up Windows 11 with a local account, ensuring you have the freedom and privacy you desire.</description>

      <description>Introduction At some point, you may need to part with your computer. Whether it’s a company-owned machine that needs to be returned, or you’re selling it to upgrade to a new model, one thing is certain—it contains a lot of your personal data. Some of that data is likely quite sensitive.&#xA;Imagine if someone gained access to your photos, addresses, documents, passwords, or financial information. The potential consequences are alarming: identity theft, unauthorized purchases, fraudulent loans, ransomware attacks, or even blackmail.</description>

      <title>Beginners Guide To Windows 10</title>

      <description>Introduction I have been asked many times for some help in getting started and achieving a basic understanding of the Windows 10 operating system (OS). Windows 10 came out on the 29th July 2015 but still people have some trouble finding their way around. This is, by definition, the result of substandard user experience and not necessarily Windows user’s own fault for not getting it. Of course a basic understanding of any computer system will help, but Windows 10 doesn’t make it as easy as it could be thanks to layers of abstraction built on what is essentially a combination of previous Windows versions underneath.</description>

      <description>Windows 10 isn&amp;rsquo;t the most robust Operating System out there. Often, the updates can break the computer in some way or another. They can clash with manufacturer updates, specifically they can attempt to replace the drivers installed by manufacturers with their own versions. Wi-Fi, optical drives and other devices can be affected, but today we will cover the keyboard and mouse - probably the most irritating of devices to fail on your laptop!</description>
