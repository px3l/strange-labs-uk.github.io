    <h2 id="ordering-a-pc-with-strange-labs-computers">Ordering a PC with Strange Labs Computers</h2>
<p>Ordering a PC with Strange Labs is a simple, but personal service. We work hand in hand with you to create your perfect PC. This means, rather than offering off the shelf configurations, we tailor your PC using current, highly rated and specifically chosen components.</p>
<h3 id="computer-specification"><strong>Computer Specification</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning the specification process starts by completing the order form. We encourage you to fill this out with as much detail as possible, especially on what you would like to get out of your PC.</p>
<p>We are aware that you have come to us as the experts, and so don&rsquo;t worry if you aren&rsquo;t sure of what you want, we will help you here!</p>
<p>Once you have submitted the form with your requirements, Strange Labs Computers begins the process of sourcing the right components to fulfill them. We will send you our suggestion for your approval, and work with you until you are happy we have designed the perfect solution for your computer.</p>
<h3 id="invoicing-and-payment-terms"><strong>Invoicing and Payment Terms</strong></h3>
<p>After the specification is approved by you, we will send you an invoice for the final amount.</p>
<p>You are welcome to pay either by bank transfer, debit or credit card, paypal or cryptocurrency. The invoice will include the details for payment, including addresses for our wallets in Nano, Bitcoin or Ether.</p>
<p>We do require payment in full, before we can start building your PC. In order to maintain our high standards, we do not keep components in stock. This is so we can source specifically chosen brand new components on your behalf from many different suppliers. We will not order components until payment has been received.</p>
<p>Please note that in order to give our customers an unbeatable price, we work to very tight margins. Therefore if you choose to pay with paypal, and some types of cryptocurrencies, there may be an additional fee for the payment service added onto the final bill. All this will be discussed prior to payment.</p>
<h3 id="building-schedule"><strong>Building Schedule</strong></h3>
<p>Once the payment is sent and received, the components will be ordered from our suppliers. It then takes an average of 3 to 5 working days to receive the components, build and test the PC. Any differences in this timescale will be relayed to you ASAP.</p>
<p>Our PCs are built with absolute attention to detail - every cable routed neatly, every screw tightened exactly. After being built, your PC is benchmarked and stress tested using several different industry standard tools. The temperatures and performance will be assessed and anything not working as expected will be resolved.</p>
<p>If there are issues with any components, usually they will arrive faulty or the fault will become apparent during testing. It is extremely rare that this happens. In the case that it does, the faulty component will be replaced immediately though this may delay the build time by a further 3 to 5 working days.</p>
<h3 id="delivery"><strong>Delivery</strong></h3>
<p>The PC will be packaged and delivered by the next working day, once the PC passes all of its tests. The tracking and set up details will be emailed to you. Once you have received the PC please check it physically and test it. Any issues ocurring in transit will need to be investigated immediately so please don&rsquo;t get rid of any packaging until the PC is tested and verified to be ok!</p>
