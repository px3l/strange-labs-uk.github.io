    <h2 id="strange-labs">Strange Labs</h2>
<p>Strange Labs is the trading name of Connor Alexander. It is now a solely online retailer and does not have a physical store.</p>
<h2 id="shipping--returns-policy">Shipping &amp; Returns Policy</h2>
<p>Strange Labs currently only sells and ships to customers that are located within the United Kingdom. The services provided by our carrier are outside our control. While we cannot guarantee delivery dates or times, UK delivery is normally no more than 1-2 working days after dispatch. In the event of a delayed delivery, we regret we are unable to offer compensation. Should you not receive your goods within 8 days, a refund or replacement will be offered. We package our products extremely carefully - in the unlikely event that they are damaged in transit or faulty, you can notify us via telephone or email. If the package or goods arrive damaged, please report this to our carrier upon delivery or as soon as possible thereafter. You must then return the goods unused and in their original condition within the next 5 working days.</p>
<p>If for any reason you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, you may cancel your order within 7 days of receipt of the goods and request a full refund or replacement. However, as per standard industry practice, we cannot accept returns of customised items or special orders (that is, items that are marked as being ones we never hold in stock and have to place special orders for). Also return transport is a customer’s expense. You must notify us within 7 days of receiving your goods via telephone or email if you wish to make a return. You must then return the goods unused and in their original condition within the next 5 working days. It is your responsibility to insure the goods with the carrier you use to return them as we are unable to process a refund until we receive the returned goods, and we cannot accept any liability for goods we do not receive.</p>
<p>We will either replace or process a refund upon receipt of the goods within 7 working days, according to your requirements. We cannot accept returns not in the original undamaged packaging and condition, unless faulty. If you have simply changed your mind, you can only return the item within the 7 day period from point of sale. Non faulty returns in store or posted are subject to a 10% restocking fee.</p>
<h3 id="warranty">Warranty</h3>
<p>All new PCs come with a 12 month warranty as standard. All refurbished PCs come with 90 days warranty as standard, unless otherwise stated. Warranty period is from the point of sale. All services and repairs come with a 90 day warranty as standard. Warranties may be extended at our discretion. Warranties for PCs cover hardware failure only. Accidental damage, attempts to repair by the customer, customisation or other manipulation of the hardware by the customer will void the warranty. Software and software based services are not covered under warranty unless specified.</p>
<p>Sometimes Windows will damage itself through no fault of the user. In this case, we will try to help as best we can and will be discussed on a per job basis.</p>
<p>Batteries are often second hand, and as consumable items, are hit and miss as to how much charge they hold. We guarantee 45 minutes of charge and can replace batteries if they hold less charge than that, free of cost.</p>
<h3 id="lifetime-support">Lifetime Support</h3>
<p>Strange Labs offers lifetime support for the time you use one of our PCs. This comes in the form of remote support via email, or software, depending on the issue. To take advantage of this service, please email us at <a href="mailto:info@strangelabs.io">info@strangelabs.io</a> or use our online chat.</p>
<h3 id="consumer-rights-act-2015">Consumer Rights Act 2015</h3>
<p>As per the act, for any goods purchased you have 30 days &ldquo;right to reject&rdquo; period, if the goods are found to be faulty.</p>
<h3 id="terms-of-hardware-drop-off-and-uncollected-goods">Terms of hardware drop off and Uncollected Goods</h3>
<p>When you drop off your hardware for diagnoses or repair, it counts as a Bailment and Strange Labs is the Bailee. We have temporary possession of goods, but you have legal ownership. There are many circumstances in which you may not be able to get to the store to collect your hardware. In this case, you must keep us up to date. After 3 months of no collection we will make reasonable attempt to contact you giving you three weeks to collect your hardware. After the three weeks, if no collection has been made, we will give you the second warning and another three week collection period. If after both these periods the items are still not collected, we will become entitled to dispose, recycle or resell the items to recover our costs.</p>
