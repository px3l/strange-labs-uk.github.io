<p>If you are involved in any of these activities, you probably mostly do your work and your hobby related socialising online. It is hard to meet up other than at peoples houses, or in big corporate offices or desk spaces. Fortunately the world is changing and physical hubs for digital activities are starting to emerge in our cities. PC and console gamers have the likes of gaming cyber-cafes but where can the other technology enthusiasts go? The coders, hardware modders and the hackers?</p>
