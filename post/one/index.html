<h3>Are you a programmer? A gamer? A custom PC builder or hardware hobbyist?</h3>

<p>If you are involved in any of these activities, you probably mostly do your work and your hobby related socialising online. It is hard to meet up other than at peoples houses, or in big corporate offices or desk spaces. Fortunately the world is changing and physical hubs for digital activities are starting to emerge in our cities. PC and console gamers have the likes of gaming cyber-cafes but where can the other PC enthusiasts go? The coders, hardware modders and the hackers?</p>

<p><strong>Strange Labs is built for computing enthusiasts</strong>, whether it is coding, hacking, building or gaming you are into. It is our intention to become a go to place for advice, a calm and reliable working environment and to meet other like-minded people.</p>

<p>We have 350Mb/s internet, available to use in store, expert advice on hand, and repairs or upgrades whenever you need.</p>

<p>There are meetups, workshops and events held each week and demo machines set up for general use.</p>
